# NodeOAuth2
Repository for the NodeOAuth2 code in my attempt at a secure wireless remote control.

The idea is that this will be a secure resource for the Raspberry pi to handshake against with the NodeMCU to create an inhouse validation routine that can be customized, and ultimately allow for identification of inflitration and the ability to reset the security tokens programatically.
